=head1 NAME

Ryu::Sink - base representation for a thing that receives events

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is currently of limited utility.

 my $src = Ryu::Source->new;
 my $sink = Ryu::Sink->new;
 $sink->from($src);
 $sink->source->say;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 from

Given a source, will attach it as the input for this sink.

The key difference between L</from> and L</drain_from> is that this method will mark the sink as completed
when the source is finished. L</drain_from> allows sequencing of multiple sources, keeping the sink active
as each of those completes.
